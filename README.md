ArtBlock
========

ArtBlock is an ad-blocking Chrome extension based on the [AdBlock](https://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/) extension. It replaces all ads with artwork images from [Artsy](http://artsy.net). As an example, the top section of [www.independent.co.uk](http://www.independent.co.uk/) looks something like this with the extension enabled:
